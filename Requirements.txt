Requirements for the Client-Side (Screen Capture and Sender)

The client script relies on the following Python libraries:

1. `pyautogui`: For capturing the screen.
2. `cv2` (OpenCV): For handling image processing (converting between color spaces, displaying the image).
3. `numpy`: For handling image arrays (since `pyautogui.screenshot()` returns a `PIL` image, which is then converted to a NumPy array).
4. `pickle`: For serializing (converting) the captured image into a byte stream.
5. `struct`: For packing and unpacking data size information to ensure frames are sent correctly.

Client Requirements (`client.py`):

pyautogui==0.9.53
opencv-python==4.8.0.74
numpy==1.23.4


Requirements for the Server-Side (Receiver and Saver)

The server script relies on the following Python libraries:

1. `cv2` (OpenCV): For handling image processing (saving images and displaying them in a window).
2. `pickle`: For deserializing (converting) the byte stream back into image frames.
3. `struct`: For packing and unpacking data size information to ensure frames are received correctly.
4. `os`: For checking and creating directories where frames will be saved.
5. `datetime`: For generating timestamps (if needed for filenames, though not strictly used in the code you provided).

Server Requirements (`server.py`):

opencv-python==4.8.0.74


Common Requirements

Both the client and server require the following shared libraries:

- `pickle` and `struct` are part of Python’s standard library, so there is no need to install them separately.
- `os` and `datetime` are also part of Python’s standard library and do not need to be installed.

Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

To easily set up the dependencies for both the client and server, create a `requirements.txt` file that includes the necessary libraries:

pyautogui==0.9.53
opencv-python==4.8.0.74
numpy==1.23.4


Installation Instructions

To install the necessary libraries, you can run the following command in your project directory (where the `requirements.txt` file is located):

pip install -r requirements.txt


This will install all the required dependencies for both the client and server scripts.
