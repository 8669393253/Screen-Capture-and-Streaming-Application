# Screen-Capture-and-Streaming-Application
This project allows you to capture the screen of your machine, send the captured frames over a network, and then receive, display, and save these frames on a server. The system works with two Python scripts: one for the client that captures the screen and sends the frames, and another for the server that receives the frames.
